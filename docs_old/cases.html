software services provided by this company are complicating fault diagnosis. </span></h4><p><span>They provide software services to many corporate clients. </span><span>When a client reports a problem the support team needs to find which service the fault occurred in and which team to contact to fix it. </span><span>Faults can be attributed to the wrong team, </span><span>and it can take a day to trouble-shoot and report back. </span><span>The more teams incorrectly assigned the fault the longer the delay to a fix. </span></p><p><span class="solution">Solution: </span><span>An instruction guide that can deal with complex decision logic for the support staff to determine which service has errored and which team to contact. </span><span>The guide must be easily updateable by support, so new problems and any number of variations of existing ones can be readily added to the tool. </span><span class="summary">Saving on time + costs spent on incorrectly assigned problems, missed SLA

experienced consultants' time. </span></p><p><span class="solution">Solution: </span><span>An instruction guide that walks a consultant, step by step, </span><span>through collecting data from many sources, with different techniques, </span><span>then running actions it, to finally generating reports. </span><span>Whilst accommodating detours and pitfalls; security, compliance or cultural hurdles, and any permutations and variations thereof. </span></p><p><span>So a new starter can get productive very quickly, without drawing on your experienced team's time.

step-by-step, filling in a claim, without leaving the app. </span></p><p><span>By presenting a form as discrete steps with just the information needed to complete an input, </span><span>you reduce information and choice overload, and the client stress. </span></p><p><span>For instance, a first step could ask the client to enter their name, the second their postcode, and so on. </span><span>This
